## Analysis ##
Proponents of a Des Moines bikesharing program aim to use this data to suggest whether this program would resonate in their city. I caution using this data to forecast the success of a bikesharing program elsewhere, especially a city that does not share similar characteristics to New York City. 

Advocates should review this data for the insights it holds. They should also consider the investment, return, and existing culture of Des Moines to make a determination on how viable a bikesharing program could be in this city. They also must consider the infrastructure needed to support this program, including new bike lanes, accessible roads, and location of bike repair shops. They should only proceed with public approval.
